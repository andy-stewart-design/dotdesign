### Figma

I'm all in on Figma, despite the whole Adobe thing. Like a lot of the industry, Figma has become my most used, and loved, tool for day-to-day design workâ€”so much so that I've spent the better part of the past two years helping our team adopt it as our primary digital design program.

### Adobe Creative Suite

I was using Adobe's design programs before I even went to design school. I spend most of time in Illustrator, Photoshop, and After Effects with a dash of Indesign for good measure. That said, I've feelt increasingly frustrated with Adobe's product management and would like to invest more heavily in alternatives like Affinity's suite of apps and the browser-based motion design tool Fable.
